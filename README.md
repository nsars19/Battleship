The game of Battleship. Part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship) curriculum.

This was built for several reasons:
  - To practice test-driven development (and learning JS testing software)
  - For further learning of React
  - To learn component-based styling (using Styled Components)
